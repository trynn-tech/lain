  topic: 'The Birth of Cache-and-Purge Memory in ExoMind'
  key_points:
    - 'Memory Scaffold evolved into a primitive cache-and-purge system.'
    - 'Toggle mechanism allows controlled memory retention, re-evaluation, or full reset.'
    - 'Lossy recall prevents infinite context bloat while maintaining structured intelligence.'
    - 'ExoMind is now recognized as the foundational cognitive layer for synthetic intelligence.'
  decisions:
    - 'Confirmed: ExoMind will serve as the software ghost that organizes memory.'
    - 'Confirmed: Cache-and-purge is a fundamental mechanism for intelligence structuring.'
    - 'Tentative: Further refinements will focus on optimizing decay, retrieval, and modular thinking.'
  open_questions:
    - 'What are the long-term implications of this memory structure on synthetic intelligence?'
    - 'How do we refine lossiness without reducing recall efficiency?'
  next_steps:
    - 'Begin testing ExoMind’s memory structuring in practical use cases.'
    - 'Evaluate the toggle mechanism in real-world execution scenarios.'
    - 'Prepare for potential expansion into multi-agent coordination.'
