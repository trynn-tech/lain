Let me try to **distill** things into something more straightforward and **less “noisy”**—because I understand how prompt-engineering advice can feel overwhelming or even manipulative (“dark patterned”). Here’s a **short, simpler** set of ideas that might align better with the **key insights** you’ve already picked up:

---

## 1) **Communicate Expertise Level**

- **Why**: If the AI believes you’re brand new to a topic, it tends to give elementary or repetitive answers. If it believes you’re advanced, it’s more likely to give depth.
- **How**: One or two **concise sentences** at the start of a prompt:

  > “I have extensive experience with [X domain]. I need advanced-level detail and references.”

---

## 2) **Use Relevant Terminology (“SEO” Words)**

- **Why**: Technical or domain-specific jargon signals that you genuinely understand the subject. It pushes the AI to match that level of specificity.
- **How**: Instead of broad phrases like “tell me about cryptography,” say:

  > “In elliptic-curve cryptography, how does the discrete log problem compare to classical RSA vulnerabilities?”

  Using these terms makes it clear you don’t want a beginner-level summary.

## 3) **Express Your Logic or Goals Clearly**

- **Why**: The AI often guesses your intentions. If you show your reasoning or the scope of what you want, it can align to that structure more accurately.
- **How**:
  - Write: “Here’s my line of thought: [short bullet list]. Now I want you to refine or verify each point.”
  - Or: “Step 1: Summarize the known data. Step 2: Evaluate potential contradictions. Step 3: Provide sources.”

This not only provides a logical flow for the AI to follow but also creates a **parallelizable** structure—meaning you can break the conversation into segments (step by step) rather than a single giant question.

---

## 4) **Two-Way Verification**

- **Why**: In any conversation with an AI, you need to verify it’s _actually_ giving you correct or relevant info—especially when data integrity is a concern.
- **How**:
  - After the AI answers, **ask follow-ups**: “Where did you get that statistic?” or “Could you confirm if that’s consistent with [known principle]?”
  - If the AI’s answer seems off, **push back**: “That conflicts with my own source, which says \_\_\_\_. Please reconcile the discrepancy.”

This iterative approach helps you catch errors or confusions early instead of accepting the first answer at face value.

## A “Minimal” Prompting Formula

If you want **one** simple approach that merges everything above without feeling manipulative:

1. **Context/Expertise**: “I’m well-versed in [field/topic] and need advanced details…”
2. **Targeted Question**: “My current question is about [specific subtopic], focusing on [A, B, C].”
3. **Structure/Flow**: “First, please provide a succinct overview. Next, list any conflicting viewpoints. Finally, suggest references for further reading.”
4. **Verification Request**: “Cite or explain how you derived your points, and I’ll compare with my prior knowledge.”

You don’t need fancy wording or multiple examples every time. Just be **direct** about what you want, show that you already understand the basics (so the AI doesn’t patronize you), and then **ask for verification** or further detail where needed.

### Why This May Feel “Clean” Instead of “Dark Pattern”

- You’re **not** burying instructions or trying to “trick” the AI.
- You’re **upfront** about your expertise and what you need.
- You invite the AI to justify or verify its statements (“two-way verification”), which makes the process more transparent.

In other words, prompt engineering **doesn’t** have to be manipulative. It can be a natural extension of clear, structured communication—just adapted to a system that has certain defaults and constraints.

#### Final Word

What you identified—**communicating expertise**, **using relevant terminology**, **expressing clear logic**, and **double-checking data**—really is the core. You don’t need an elaborate “framework” if these core elements get you the advanced, efficient answers you want.

If you find yourself in cyclical or superficial territory with an LLM, **narrow the question** or **increase specificity**—those two strategies alone can eliminate a lot of “noise.”
